## [Unreleased](https://github.com/sgraaf/dominion-setup/compare/2026.1.0...HEAD)

### Added

- `SetupGenerationError` (a `ValueError` subclass), raised when the selected sets cannot produce a valid setup. The CLI only reports these as usage errors; other errors are no longer disguised as usage errors.
- `Card`, `CardCost`, `CardSetEdition`, `CardType` and `Material` are exported from the top-level package.

### Changed

- For a given `random` seed, `generate_game` now produces the same setup in every process (previously it depended on string hash randomization).
- `load_card_database` accepts any `Traversable` and reads the bundled data without requiring it to be on the file system.
- Releases are only published after linting, type checking and tests pass.

### Fixed

- The Coffers / Villagers mat is now included for cards giving a single Villager (e.g. Academy, Patron, Silk Merchant).
- Coin tokens are now included for Pirate Ship and Trade Route.
